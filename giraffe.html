                <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
                <p>The giraffe (Giraffa) is an African artiodactyl mammal, the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant. The giraffe's chief distinguishing characteristics are its extremely long neck and legs, its horn-like ossicones, and its distinctive coat patterns. The coat patterns of modern giraffes may also have coincided with these habitat changes. Asian giraffes are hypothesised to have had more okapi-like colouration</p>
                
                
     <p>The giraffe has a distribution which includes southern Chad, the Central African Republic, northern Cameroon, and the northeastern DR Congo. adult giraffes move about to gain the best view of an approaching predator, relying on their size and ability to defend themselves rather than on camouflage, which may be more important for calves. Each individual giraffe has a unique coat pattern. Giraffe calves inherit some coat pattern traits from their mothers, and variation in some spot traits is correlated with neonatal survival.<p>
                
                
   <p>Giraffes possibly see in colour, and their senses of hearing and smell are sharp. The ears are movableâ€Š and the nostrils are slit-shaped, which may be an adaptation against blowing sand<p>
                
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the giraffe just next to the Koala.</p>
